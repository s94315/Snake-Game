# Snake-Game

Project Details:
• The Snake will have the ability to move in all four directions.
• The snake’s length grows as it eats food. When the snake crosses itself or strikes the
perimeter of the box.
• The game is marked over.
• Food is always given at different position.

2. To create a Snake Game in Java, you can follow these steps:
• Create a Java project: Start by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE or
code editor.
• Set up the game board: Define a grid or a game board where the snake and food will
move. You can represent the grid using a 2D array or any other suitable data structure.
• Create the Snake class: Define a class to represent the snake. The class should include
properties such as length, direction, and body segments. Implement methods to move
the snake, check for collisions, and grow the snake when it eats food.

• Create the Food class: Define a class to represent the food. The food should appear at
random positions on the game board.
• Implement game logic: Write the main game loop that controls the flow of the game.
This loop should handle user input, update the positions of the snake and food, and
check for collisions.
• Handle user input: Allow the player to control the direction of the snake using arrow
keys or other input methods.
• Display the game: Use Java Swing or any other graphics library to create a graphical
user interface for the game. Display the game board, snake, and food on the screen,
and update their positions during each iteration of the game loop.
• Handle collisions: Check for collisions between the snake, food, and game boundaries.
End the game if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, and update the score
if the snake eats food.
• Add scoring: Keep track of the player's score based on the length of the snake and the
number of food items eaten.
• Implement game over: Display a game over message when the game ends, and allow
the player to restart the game if desired.
